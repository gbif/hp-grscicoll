### Introduction to the GBIF API

The [GBIF Data Use Club](https://www.gbif.org/data-use-club) regularly organises webinars on various GBIF-related technical topics. Below is the recorded webinar introducing the GBIF API. It explains how to get started with any GBIF-developed API function (including the GRSciColl API). Below is the recorded webinar introducing the GBIF API.
