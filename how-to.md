## How to edit a GRSciColl collection or institution

There are three ways to update information on GRSciColl:
* you can suggest a change
* you can become an editor
* you can import data

### Suggest a change

Anyone can suggest changes by clicking on any GRSciColl entry, then:
* Click on `Edit`
* Click on the `Suggest` toggle button
* Make your suggestion and leave your email address and a comment

You can also suggest adding new entries, merging duplicates and transforming institution entries into collections.

The suggestion will be reviewed by institutional editors, country editors or GBIF Staff depending on the entry edited.

### Become editor

There are two types of editors in GRSciColl: editors and mediators. Both can edit data on GRSciColl and review changes but only mediators can delete, merge and transform entries.
An editor (or mediator) can be given the permissions to edit:
* one or several collections
* one or several institutions (and their associated collections)
* one or several countries (and their associated institutions and collections)

To become a GRSciColl editor, you will need to have a [GBIF user account](https://www.gbif.org/user/profile) associated with your institutional email address. Please send us an email at scientific-collections@gbif.org to notify us that you would like to become an editor.

### Import data

The [GBIF Collections API](https://www.gbif.org/developer/registry#collections) allows for editing without going through the web interface. The API also has an experimental feature to upload batches of collection and institutions. See the documentation [here](https://github.com/gbif/registry/blob/dev/docs/grscicoll_batches.md).

If you are interested in using the API for editing GRSciColl, the permission system and requirements are the same as for becoming an editor.

## Editing Guidelines

### How to represent my institution and collections?

There is no hierarchy between collection entries nor between institution entries.
Institutions decide the level of granularity you want to use to represent their collections. For examples, an institution could have an entry for a bird collection and another for a mammal collection while another institution would have only one entry for their vertebrate collection.

In doubt, you can follow these practical guidelines:
* Make one institution entry per physical locations (the campus, building where the collections are hosted).
* Make one collection entry for each group of specimen with same point of contact (the person who can tell more about the collection, possibly arrange a loan).

### What information should I put in GRSciColl?

Although very few fields are mandatory, we recommend to provide as much information as possible. For institutions, it is important to provide a name, code and address (or at least country). For collections, don't forget to add an associated institution.

### What should be my collection/institution code?

Codes donâ€™t have to be unique in GRSciColl and an entry can have several codes. The codes should reflect what is used in practice (what is on the labels).
Note that GRSciColl codes are used to match occurrences published on GBIF to GRSciColl entries.

### What should be my collection/institution identifiers?

An entry can be associated with external identifiers such as: wikidata, ROR, DOI etc.
Only editors can add identifiers to entries.
Note that GRSciColl identifiers are used to match occurrences published on GBIF to GRSciColl entries.
