## What is the Global Registry of Scientific Collections?

The Global Registry of Scientific Collections (GRSciColl), is a comprehensive and community-curated clearinghouse of collection information hosted in the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org) registry. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers, institutions and the scientific community at large. GRSciColl provides information about physical scientific collections, including their content, location, contacts, and associated institutions. It also serves as a reference for institution and collection codes and identifiers.

The information in GRSciColl is maintained by a community of editors, including representatives from registered institutions and national editors. The suggestion system enables anyone to contribute by updating, adding, or merging records, which are then reviewed by relevant individuals. GRSciColl also synchronizes regularly with external sources such as Index Herbariorum, ensuring up-to-date and reliable information.


## History of the data

The GRSciColl data has been built over the years. A lot of the institution and collections information has been entered by a dedicated team of curators and members of the community. Some data comes from external sources such as [Index Herbariorum](https://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/), the [Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio)](https://www.idigbio.org) and national registries.

### How it all started

GRSciColl was originally developed by the [Consortium of the Barcode of Life (CBOL)](https://www.gbif.org/participant/287) and hosted by [the Smithsonian Institution](https://www.si.edu) until 2018.

> Schindel DE, Miller SE, Trizna MG, Graham E, Crane AE. The Global Registry of Biodiversity Repositories: A Call for Community Curation. Biodivers Data J. 2016 Aug 26;(4):e10293. doi: 10.3897/BDJ.4.e10293. PMID: 27660523; PMCID: PMC5018115.

In 2018, GRSciColl was adopted by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) registry (see [this news item](https://www.gbif.org/news/5kyAslpqTVxYqZTwYn1cub/gbif-provides-new-home-for-the-global-registry-of-scientific-collections).

The following years,
* An [API was developed for GRSciColl](/api)
* GBIF worked with [Index Herbariorum](https://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/) to set up weekly synchronizations of the information in GRSciColl.
* Collection information was imported from [iDigBio](https://www.idigbio.org).
* The linking of specimen-related occurrences published on GBIF to GRSciColl entries was enabled.
* The metadata of datasets published on GBIF became a possible source of information for collections.

You can read more about some of the history of GRSciColl in [this blog article](https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/grscicoll-2021/).

### Where are we now

GRSciColl has now a suggestion system as well as editors which review those suggestions. This system enables community curation, anyone can contribute by updating, adding, or merging records.
We also work with national organizations to import of data from their collection registries in GRSciColl.

Subset of GRSciColl can be part of [GBIF-Hosted Portals](https://www.gbif.org/hosted-portals). See for example [the UK Natural Sciences Collections Portal](https://data.dissco-uk.org).
